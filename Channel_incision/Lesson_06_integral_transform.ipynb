The integrand seems annoying and messy, but it actually fairly easy to calculate from topographic data (you are just adding drainage area along the length of the channel. You will never need to do this yourself, there is software for calculating the integrand. It also has dimensions length. So we can define a coordinate, $\\chi$:\n",
