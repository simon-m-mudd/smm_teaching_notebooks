    "Now that we have seen the basic form of channel profiles (see Lesson 1), we can start thinking about what might cause this form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly two hundred years ago, there was something of a raging debate as to whether or not rivers could carve valleys. In Europe, one of the groups that promoted this idea was the \"Edinburgh\" school, which was based out of the Scottish Branch of the British Geological Survey, led, at the time, by Archibald Geikie. The impact of rivers on our post-glacial landscapes was perhaps not so obvious, but a rivers' power to erode the landscape is quite obvious if you travel along the Grand Canyon in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the first and second directors of the United States Geological Surveys made observations in the canyons of the western states that helped convince others that rivers did indeed drive valley incision. The second director, G.K. Gilbert, wrote a highly influential report on the Geology of the Henry Mountains (a range in Utah) that not only contributed to a number of geophysical ideas (isostasy, for one), but also contained a chapter on erosion that expounded on erosion of channels by water. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Gilbert, G.K., 1877. Geology of the Henry Mountains (USGS Unnumbered Series), Geology of the Henry Mountains, Monograph. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. https://doi.org/10.3133/70038096*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get this report online. Every geomorphologist should read chapter 5. In fact, if you haven't read it, stop reading this and read that chapter. I'll wait. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, finished? Great. Gilbert's chapter is modern. What I mean by that is his approach and his speculations would not seem out of place in a paper appearing today. If you look at other papers from this time they can seem quite dated. For examples of this one need look no further than the papers by W.M. Davis, who was the most famous geomorphologist of his era, but who was mostly wrong, took a totally qualitative approach, and was an absolutely dreadful human being. \n",
    "\n",
    "Pn the other hand Gilbert was far ahead of his time. Which is particularly notable because his approach to things fell out of favour for a number of decades and didn't really find traction again until the late 50s and early 60s (With the exception of the, uh, exceptional papers by R.E. Horton in the 30s and 40s, but we won't get into those here). \n",
    "\n",
    "Gilbert says on page 115 of his report: \"We have already seen that erosion is favoured by declivity. Where the declivity is great the agents of erosion are powerful; where it is small they are weak; where there is no declivity they are powerless. Moreover it has been shown that their power increases with the declivity in more than simple\n",
    "ratio.” That last bit means that the relationship between declivity (we would say gradient) and erosion rate is *nonlinear*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also suppose that erosion is favoured when there is more water. And to get more water, you need more drainage area. We can state this in a very simple equation, which is exactly what Howard and Kirby did in 1983:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E = k A^m S^n$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E$ is the erosion rate, $A$ is drainage area, $S$ is channel gradient, $m$ and $n$ are empirical coefficients, and $k$ is a lumped \"erodibility\" that is a Pandora's box of complexity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation above is often called the \"stream power law\". It is a *MASSIVE* oversimplification of what happens during river incision. It is oversimplified to the degree that many geomorphologists think it is obscene. But it is a useful conceptual model that has helped informed many studies. There are a number of studies showing that in the right circumstances, it can be used to understand how channels evolve. So we are going to use it here. "

    "* Stream power is designed for channels that incise through bedrock. If the channel is alluvial (that is, its bed and banks are made of sediment, even in the biggest floods), then stream power does not apply.\n",
    "* In reality, river incision into bedrock depends on many factors. With a few exceptions, water alone does not erode the bed, so more advanced incision rules include sediment supply. \n",
    "* Usually, small discharges don't really modify the bed: you need to get beyond a threshold discharge to incise. So more advanced incision laws take this into accout. \n",

    "Another concept you should be aware of is the concept of \"steady state\". Steady state means that something is not changing in time. You could have various forms of this.

We can then compare that form to actual channels and see if they have been perturbed, and maybe make some assumptions about the nature of that perturbation. To start, we will use this assumption:\n",
