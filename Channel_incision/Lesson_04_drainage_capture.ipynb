    "* Typical channels have a concave up profile. And there is a power law relationship between slope and drainage areas: $S = k_s A^{-\\theta}$\n",
    "* The steepness of channels (as indicated by the steepness index $k_s$) is thought to be related to erosion rates. And the stream power law proposes a relationship between channel steepness, erodibility, and uplift rates. Despite many flaws, the stream power law has been used to help with conceptual models of channel evolution. \n",
    "* The stream power law (and its more complex variants) all suggest that changes in erosion rates will propagate upstream. If erosion rates increase, a **knickzone** will move upstream. "

    "We have run some simulations where changing the uplift rate can change the profile of the river. \n",

    "\n",
    "A river's drainage area can change if one side of a drainage divide is eroding more quickly than the other, and the divide migrates into the slowly eroding landscape. \n",
    "\n",
    "An extreme version of this is drainage capture. Drainage capture can happen when the headwaters of one river erode into another river, and capture the other river's drainage area. Suddenly, a small headwater catchment can have a much larger river running down it. Because the headwaters will be relatively steep, this section of the river, now with much more discharge, should erode quickly. \n",
