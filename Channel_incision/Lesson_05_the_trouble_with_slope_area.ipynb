    "* Channels tend to have a higher gradient near their headwaters (i.e., parts of the network with low drainage area).\n",
    "* If the landscape is on uniform bedrock, and has an uplift rate that has remained steady for a long time, the relationship between slope and area looks like $S = k_s A^{-\\theta}$. \n",
    "* If the landscape is perturbed in some way, channel steepness will diverge from this idealised shape. \n",
    "* We might look for parts of the channel experiencing some sort of perturbation (i.e., changing lithology, changing uplift in space and time) by looking for parts of the landscape that are steeper than others. \n",
    "* Channel gradient doesn't work since it is changing along the channel even if there are no perturbations. So instead we look for changes in the \"channel steepness index\", or $k_s$ from the equation above. Areas of elevated $k_s$ are also known as knickpoints.\n"

Then,  between junctions, drainage are doesn't change much, but channels are rough: you get some boulders making some steps, or a little bit of slack water behind a log, etc. These mean that local gradient can change a lot between tributary junctions. So this shows up as a bunch of different gradients at apparently the same drainage area. \n",

When you see papers with slope-area data, it has been through some smoothing and binning routine, so you tend not to see figures this messy in scientific paper. But I assure you **all** slope area data is this messy before you start to bin and smooth it. \n",
