    "Imagine yourself in a nice mountain valley walking along a stream. You start quite low in the valley. The stream is nice and wide. As you go upstream the river gets smaller. This is because it is draining less area. In addition, the stream will probably change its gradient. Near the mountain tops, channels tend to get steeper. Because channels tend to get steeper as we move along them, we can call their profiles concave. There are exceptions, but the general trend of rivers is to get steeper as you go upstream. \n",
