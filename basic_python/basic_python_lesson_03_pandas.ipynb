    "`pandas` comes from \"python data analysis library\". It sounds better than \"pdal\". Although I like bicylces so I might have called it \"pedal\". Anyway, I did not write pandas. [A guy working for a hedge fund did](https://pandas.pydata.org/about/index.html), because analysis of financial data often involves dealing with messy time series data. This package has ended up being immensely useful to all kinds of people and now forms one of the keystones of data science in python. "
