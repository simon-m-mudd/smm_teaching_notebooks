    "Back in the late 1800s, people (including G.K. Gilbert) were speculating about the rates at which soil was formed. This might depend on things like the number of burrowing animals, the rock type, the number of plants, and other factors. \n",

    "The soil is \"produced\" from somewhere, and usually it is produced from some combination of conversion of rock to sediments, addition of organic matter, and deposition of dust. But we are going to focus on the conversion of rock material to sediment that can move. \n",

Note that when you're doing numerical calculations you have to be consistent with units. We will always do calculations in length units of ***metres*** (m), time units of ***years*** (y) and mass units of ***kilograms*** (kg).

    "We also discussed in the lecture an alternative way in which soil may be produced: where there are very slow rates of soil production where there is bare bedrock, then soil peaks at some intermediate thickness before decreasing exponentially with increasing soil thickness. This model dates back to Gilbert (1877), and makes intuitive sense: water is needed for weathering processes as we discussed today. If there is bare bedrock, water is quickly transported through overland flow and little weathering can take place. If there is too much soil, then it's unlikely to be fully saturated down to the bedrock--soil interface.\n",

    "You should recognise some of these parameters from the exponential equation. The first part of the equation is the exponential function multiplied by a coefficient, $\\alpha$. $W$ is still the weathering rate, $W_0$ is the inital rate of soil production where there is no soil, and $h$ is soil depth. There are two new parameters: $h_c$ is a critical soil depth (m), and $c$ is an empirical constant. Anhert (1977) suggests that $c$ might vary between 1.7 - 2.3, $h_c$ might vary between 0.6 - 1.5, and $\\alpha$ between 0 - 1. If $\\alpha = 1$, then the relationship is simply the exponential function."
