= Notebooks for geomorphology teaching

By Simon M Mudd

== Overview

This repository contains jupyter notebooks for teaching various concepts in geomorphology.

The notebooks are intended for use on the University of Edinburgh's https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable[Notable] service.

== Usage instructions

Here is how to get started using the notebooks

=== Using these notebooks in Noteable

. If you are in one of Simon's classes, you should be able to find the Notable link within the course materials section of the Learn page.

. If you are not in a course, you can use the https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/learning-technology/noteable/accessing-noteable[direct ease login]. If you do this, make sure you start a notebook server with the "GeoScience" kernel.

=== Using these notebooks in docker

If you are not at the University of Edinburgh and are on a https://www.docker.com/[Docker]-friendly operating system (Linux, MacOS, or a version of Windows 10 that has https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10[Windows linux Subsystem 2]), you can download our docker image. See this website for instructions: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker

For a quickstart:

. Once you have downloaded the container, run:
+
[source,console]
----
$ docker run -it -v C:\LSDTopoTools:/LSDTopoTools -p 8888:8888 lsdtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker
----
+
. then start notebook server with:
+
[source,console]
----
# jupyter notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --port 8888 --no-browser --allow-root
----
+
. Then copy the `token` (NOT THE HTML address).
.. Open a web broser and go to http://localhost:8888/
.. In the password box, enter the `token` that you copied.


==== Using notebooks with a conda install

You can also use a https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html[conda] https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#building-identical-conda-environments[environment].

Here is the explicit environment file: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/lsdtt_pytools_docker/tree/master/conda_environments

Download the `pytools_env_explicit.txt` file and run:

[source,console]
----
$ conda create --name lsd_pytools --file pytools_env_explicit.txt
