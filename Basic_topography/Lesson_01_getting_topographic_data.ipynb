    "    * The NASADEM, which is a reprocessed version of the SRTM data (so theoretically better quality than SRTM from the same base data).\n",
    "    * The ALOS World 3D 30 m dataset. This is based on optical data made using photogrammetry from the ALOS satellites. It is a downscaled version of the 5 m dataset (the difference is that the 30 m one is free).\n",
    "    * The Copernicus DEM, which is 30m grid comes from a variety of sources but much of it from the TanDEM-X radar satellites.\n",
    "* Vast quantities of high resolution data from lidar (cm scale point clouds and 1 m grid cell size DEMs).\n",
