    "**Side note**: The grid cell size in a geospatial raster is the length of the edges of each pixel. This is often referred to as the \"resolution\" but technically the resolution is defined as the minimum distance between two objects that can be separated in an image, so the resolution of a raster is larger than the grid cell size. [You can read about that here](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-differentiation-between-grid-spacing-and-and-to-Grasso/23ed9f85a67dea01eb6501701478555721b6af13).\n",

But the radar only imaged the surface over a very short period so the accuracy is not as good as DEMs based on many years of stacked images (such as AW3D 30 or the Copernicus DEM). SRTM, however, is unique in that is a snapshot of the Earth's surface in 2000, so comparisons to much later topographic data (AW3D and Copernicus) should be able to detect large changes, such as big landslides. The accuracy of these DEM is not sufficient to find small changes, however. \n",
